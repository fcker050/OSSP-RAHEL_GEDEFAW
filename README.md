## Introduction

Operating systems form the backbone of modern computing. They manage hardware and software resources and provide services for computer programs. This project focuses on Windows Server 2022, a robust operating system used in many enterprise environments. The assignment also covers system programming, specifically implementing the `accept()` system call, which is essential for network programming.

## Installation Steps

To set up Windows Server 2022, follow these steps:

1. **Download Windows Server 2022**: Obtain the ISO file from the official Microsoft website or your institution.

2. **Create a Bootable USB Drive**:
   - Use tools like Rufus or the Windows USB/DVD Download Tool.
   - Select the downloaded ISO file and choose your USB drive.

3. **Boot from USB**:
   - Insert the USB drive into your computer.
   - Restart the computer and enter the BIOS/UEFI settings.
   - Change the boot order to prioritize the USB drive.

4. **Install Windows Server 2022**:
   - Follow the on-screen instructions.
   - Choose the edition you need (Standard or Datacenter).
   - Accept the license terms.
   - Select the installation type (Custom for a clean install).
   - Choose the disk where you want to install the OS.

5. **Complete the Installation**:
   - Set up your administrator account.
   - Configure network settings.
   - Install updates as needed.

After completing these steps, you will have a fully functional Windows Server 2022 environment.

## System Call Implementation

The `accept()` function is crucial for server applications that handle incoming network connections. This function allows a server to accept a connection request from a client. Hereâ€™s a simple implementation outline:

1. **Include Necessary Headers**:
   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <stdlib.h>
   #include <string.h>
   #include <sys/types.h>
   #include <sys/socket.h>
   #include <netinet/in.h>
   ```

2. **Create a Socket**:
   ```c
   int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
   ```

3. **Bind the Socket**:
   ```c
   struct sockaddr_in server_addr;
   server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
   server_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
   server_addr.sin_port = htons(port);
   bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&server_addr, sizeof(server_addr));
   ```

4. **Listen for Connections**:
   ```c
   listen(sockfd, 5);
   ```

5. **Accept a Connection**:
   ```c
   int newsockfd = accept(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&client_addr, &client_len);
   ```

6. **Handle the Connection**:
   - You can now read from and write to `newsockfd`.

This implementation serves as a foundation. You can expand it with error handling, threading, and more advanced features.

## Usage

To use the implemented `accept()` function in your server application:

1. Compile your code:
   ```bash
   gcc -o server server.c
   ```

2. Run the server:
   ```bash
   ./server
   ```

3. Connect to the server using a client application. You can create a simple client using similar socket functions.
